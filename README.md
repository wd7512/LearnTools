# LearnTools

### Stucture

 - Network
    - network (class to hold network) (need to add more insightful prints)
    - layer_dense (dense layer from layer class)
    - layer_one_to_one
    - layer_dropout
    - activation_function (custom activation function class)
    - relu / softmax / sigmoid (standard activation functions)

    - layer_conv WIP
    - layer_norm WIP (or perhaps a function to normalise data)
 - Learning
    - random_learning 

    - random_evolution_learning WIP
    - random_stochastic_learning (batch random) WIP
    - gradient descent WIP
    - stochastic gradient descent WIP
    - random_momentumn_learning WIP

# Getting started
run the command *pip install learntools*\
for network use *from learntools import Network*\
for learning use *from learntools import Learning*
